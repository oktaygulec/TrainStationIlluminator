# Train Station Lightener

<b>Problem:</b>

We have a bunch of unlightened train stations and we have to put lights on them.
In this case, we should be able to put lights on unlightened stations but, they have a starting and ending points and we should find those points and then we are puting those lights on stations.

<b>Solution:</b>

First of all, we need some numbers from user for making our sample train station so, we need to store total location and total path in some variables.
Second thing is, we need an array and it should be a 2D because we have rows and columns (paths are rows and locations are columns).
Third step is going to be making a train station sample and we are making those with nested loops. In those loops, we can generate some random numbers which is going to be 0 and 1 (0 is empty location and 1 is unlightened station) and we are going to convert those numbers to some chars for making the program more graphical (0 is going to be * and 1 is going to be -) and then we are gonna use our 2D array to store empty locations and unlightened stations.
In fourth step; we are going to use nested loops again because we have to look every single location for to ask "is my current location a station or empty location?" and we are going to question them for to lightened them or not.
And finally in final step; we are going to print the lightened train station to display with nested loops (yes i know, again...).



If you have any questions or suggestions, you can reach me at Discord (Miyajinco#3918). It would be awesome and i really appreciate for your interest.
Thanks for checking and reading my train station lightener project.
